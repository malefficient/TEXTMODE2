Johnnys tentative new .env


## Potential new things
* Starship: Cross-shell prompts. Written in rust!  https://starship.rs/
* direnv:   Might make the sort of nesting PATHS env var stuff easier
* tmux:     Not new, but would be nice to get a smaller .tmuxrc changeset

## Direnv
Not really sure yet.
Step 1) Install 'direnv', and hook it into your .bash,.zsh rc

## TODO(s) 
It would be nice if there was a way for direnv install | direnv integration failure to alert somehow in tmux status profile


See 
``` brew install direnv ```
