##Terminal multiplexing

Tmux is bad? The Kitty developer makes a pretty good use-case
 1) tmux consumes STDOUT when itâ€™s buffers get full
 2) tmux has to catch-modify and re-transmit all the VTE trickery. 
    Aside from the nested complexity, it means that all VT escape codes get processed at-least twice (double the energy)
