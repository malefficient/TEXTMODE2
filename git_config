    #If this is missing and you are using ssh keys anyway (like anyone post 2015)
    #You likely wouldn't notice an issue until, say, trying to clone a gist repo by hash (success!)
    #And then trying to push changes (fail!)
    #The only way to authenticate changes to gists** is a Personal Access Token (PAT)
    
    # Therefore, despite whatever diligence you may be using to restrict acccess / authentication via ssh keys
    # (Which, is easily done in an industry standard manner (man ssh-agent), eventually you will be confronted with the ineffable
    # 'Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.' error

    # The 'solution' to this is to request/generate a PAK, (think OAuth key), store it somewhere 
    # Store it somewhere (if you're reding this, probs the OSX keychain) 
    # and then hold your breath / ponder how it is that all the applications across all of the machines and all of the
    # OS's and environment you work in will suddenly synchronize this new shared-secret, which btw, you will really want
    # to set to expire after some amount of time, requiring you to then answer this question *again* every 30-90 days

	#This gem will push -reachable- -annotated- tags to the upstream repo by default
	#Including it is a great way to not bash your head in, both at te fact that this
	#behavior hasn't become some sort of sane default. It also avoids the cognitive
	#disonnance of rationalizing away the absurd situation that despite typing the 
	#command 'git commit xxx <tag-name-here> zzz', you haven't/arent trying to commit
	# a tag. ðŸ™„
