	#This gem will push -reachable- -annotated- tags to the upstream repo by default
	#Including it is a great way to not bash your head in, both at te fact that this
	#behavior hasn't become some sort of sane default. It also avoids the cognitive
	#disonnance of rationalizing away the absurd situation that despite typing the 
	#command 'git commit xxx <tag-name-here> zzz', you haven't/arent trying to commit
	# a tag. ðŸ™„
